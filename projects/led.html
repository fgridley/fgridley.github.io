						<h3><mark>LED Music Analysis</mark></h3>
						<h4>Arduino / Processing</h4>
						<p>This project began as an idea in the back of my head months ago.
						I knew I wanted to find a way of controlling a strip of LED lights
						and making them change along to music, but I struggled to find a
						simple way of doing it. Earlier this summer, I took Programming
						Basics, in which we learned Processing. It was then that I
						discovered that Processing works well with Arduino, and has a couple
						different libraries for analyzing music.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						I originally created a simple program which drew shapes along with the music, and once I
					 	felt confident using Processing to analyze music, I began learning
						how to communicate between a Processing project and the Arduino
						through the serial port. In my final solution, the Processing
						programming analyzes the amplitude of the computer's audio output,
						using a Fast Fourier Transform and converts that to a value between
						0 and 255, and then sends it to the Arduino which uses it as the
						brightness for the strip of LED lights. The Arduino program also
						cycles through the hues to make the lights change color. I plan on
						continuing to improve upon this project, and I would ideally like
						to find a way to make the Arduino communicate with the computer
						wirelessly, as well as a few other minor improvements.</p>
