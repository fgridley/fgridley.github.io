					<h4>web design / web development</h4>
					<p>Several months ago, I began leanring HTML and CSS in order to create
					my first portfolio website. I designed several mockups, such as the
					first image shown to the left. Because I still didn't know much about
					HTML and CSS, the first iteration of my website was pretty basic. A few
					weeks ago, I decide I wanted to attempt to redesign my portfolio, now
					with more knowledge of web development and design.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					I began by drawing sketches and figuring out what did/didn't work on
					my old website. I then moved to Illustrator to do some basic prototyping
					digital sketches and design the graphics. Once I felt confident about
					what I wanted the site to look like, I began coding. Although creating
					my original site was extremely difficult, now that I had some web
					development experience the process of redesigning my site was relatively
					simple. Through the process of designing and redesigning this website,
					I have grown to love web development, and hope to do more of it in the
					future.
