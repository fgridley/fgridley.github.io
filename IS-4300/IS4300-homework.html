                        <img src="roommate-chores.jpg" alt="Roommate chores paper sketch">
                        <p>This app is designed to make it easier for roommates to organize and assign chores. One common problem when sharing an apartment with
                            others is that it is not clear who is supposed to do what chores when, so chores often go undone. Eeach roommate would have the app,
                            and at the beginning of each week, all the roommates can set and agree on who is responsible for each chore. Those chores then show 
                            up on the assigned person's chores list. Roommates can earn points by completing chores, and the earlier they complete the chores the
                            more points they receive. This encourages roommates to actually do the chores once they are assigned. Gone are the days of a messy apartment!

                        <h4>2. Campus Event Sharing</h6>
                        <img src="campus-events.jpg" alt="Campus events paper sketch">
                        <p>There are dozens of events happening on campus every week, but finding out about these events often requires a student to coincidentally
                            see a sign posted somewhere on campus. This leaves students feeling like there aren't enough events happening, and causes a lack of
                            attendance at many events. This app would provide a complete list of all events happening on campus, giving events more visibility for 
                            a wider range of students. Students will no longer have to browse through many different social media platforms and websites to try to
                            find events to go to, as they will be able to view and sign up for/buy tickets to all the events available to them.

                        <h4>2. Task/Event Management</h6>
                        <img src="task-manager.jpg" alt="Task/event paper sketch">
                        <p>As a college student, I have many tasks and events happening all the time, and I like to stay organized so I know what I need to be
                            working on or where I need to be. There are many calendar apps out there, but I have not found one that makes it easy to manage both 
                            tasks/assignments as well as events. I want to be able to add a task or assignment to my list of things to do and have it automatically
                            show up in the calednar, so I can see both the events that are happening on a certain day as well as any tasks or assignments that are
                            due that day. Instead of having a separate task/list app and calendar app, this would combine the two, making time management simpler 
                            and more effective.
