			<h4 class="portfolio-sub-pad">Storm Safe @ SheHacks Boston</h4>
			<p class="portfolio-text">This spring, I participated in SheHacks Boston, the largest all female and non-binary hackathon in the world. This was my first hackathon, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I had a great time and learned a ton of new skills. Once I arrived a the hackathon, I joined a team of two women from a high school in New Jersey and a couple women from Northeastern. Together we planned on creating an Android app that would help people experiencing severe weather locate safe houses and prepare for natural disasters.

			None of us had created a mobile app before, and after several hours, we realized that we would not be able to learn the skills in time to create anything of substance. We made a quick decision to create a website instead, which our team had slightly more experience with. One other team member and I decided to share the design portion of the project. I created the logo above and helped with the web design elements. Although we still didn't finish the website, some of my team mebers and I are currently trying to finish the website. In the meantime, if you want to check it out, it's live at stormsafe.ca!
