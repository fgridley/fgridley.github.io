			<h4 class="portfolio-sub-pad">Creating my very first website!</h4>
			<p class="portfolio-text">Earlier this year, I deceded that as a Computer Science and Design student I should probably have a portfolio site to display my design and programming projects. This was somewhat of a daunting task as I had never designed a website before, and didn't even know any HTML or CSS. I started out trying to use a complicated Jekyll template, but without any web development experience, I had no idea how to change the template and personalize it for my needs.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			After struggling with other templates and some unsuccessful experimentation with Bootstrap, I decided to learn HTML and CSS from the ground up and build my own website from scratch, which looked a little like this:
			</p>
			<img class="portfolio-img" src="/images/old-website1.png" alt="Old website">
			<p class="portfolio-text"> Although this design was acceptable, I still wasnt quite satisfied. In a frenzy to complete a portfolio for an application for a design position, I decided to once again scrap my old site and build a new one. For this redesign, I decided to start with a photoshop mockup, shown below:
			</p>
			<img class="portfolio-img" src="/images/website mockup.png" alt="Old website">
			<p class="portfolio-text">Having a specific plan for the design and look of my website helped immensly when it came to coding everything. Although each step in the process involved a significant amount of googling and wathcing/reading tutorials, I am finally happy with the look and feel of my website. Although it isn't perfect, I am glad to finally see how far I have come in my web design knowledge since I started a few months ago.
