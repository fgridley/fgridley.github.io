			<h4>Miscellaneous Studio Artowrk</h4>
			<p class="portfolio-text">During my senior year of high school, I took an IB Studio Art course, during which I created many different pieces centering around a theme of "unspoken issues." One of the final requirements of the course was to select our best pieces from the year and design a gallery exhibition to showcase them. My exhibition is shown in the picture above. Although I will continue to add pieces to this page as I create them, as it stands now this page is a collection of pieces from my IB art course. Take a look!</p>
