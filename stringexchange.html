			<h4>String Exchange Logo Design</h4>
			<p class="portfolio-text">This brand design was created for String Exchange, a quarterly knitting and fiber spinning subscription box company in Wichita, KS. They were a brand new company, and they needed a logo as well as a header and icon for their website and social media accounts. I designed the above logo for their website header, which features a stylized ball of yarn and knitting needles.</p>
			<img class="portfolio-img" src="/images/string exchange icon.png" alt="String Exchange Icon">
			<p class="portfolio-text"> I created this version of the logo to use as an avatar for String Exchange's social media accounts and the icon on their website. The clients were extremely pleased with the results of these designs and are now featured on their website and in other promotional material.
